      <h1>Beef biryani!</h1>
      <p>
        Beef Biryani is a rich and flavorful South Asian dish made with tender
        beef, aromatic basmati rice, and a blend of traditional spices.<br />
        It is known for its bold taste, unique layers, and festive aroma that
        makes it a favorite for gatherings and special occasions.
      </p>
      <h1>How we created??!!</h1>
      <p>
        We created this Beef Biryani by marinating the beef in spices,
        slow-cooking it until tender, and then layering it with fragrant basmati
        rice. <br />
        Each layer is infused with saffron and herbs to bring out the perfect
        balance of flavor and aroma.
